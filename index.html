    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 December 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Quit Smoking</strong> mobile
      application ("we", "our", or "the app") handles user information. By using
      this app, you agree to the terms described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect or require personally identifiable
      information such as name, email address, phone number, or physical
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app may collect limited, non-personal information necessary to provide
      its core functionality, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App usage information</li>
      <li>Subscription and purchase status</li>
      <li>Anonymous device or installation identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain app functionality</li>
      <li>Manage subscriptions and premium access</li>
      <li>Improve app performance and stability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share user data for advertising
      or marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>The Quit Smoking app offers optional paid subscriptions.</p>
    <p>
      All payments are processed securely through
      <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. We do not store, process, or have
      access to your payment details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription status and entitlement management are handled using
      <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service that helps manage
      in-app subscriptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app relies on the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Play Billing</li>
      <li>RevenueCat (subscription management)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These services may collect and process information as required to provide
      their functionality. Their data handling practices are governed by their
      respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not store personal user data on our servers. Any data processed by
      third-party services is retained only for as long as necessary to provide
      their services and comply with legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancel subscriptions at any time through the Google Play Store</li>
      <li>Uninstall the app to stop further data collection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Quit Smoking app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We
      do not knowingly collect data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>
