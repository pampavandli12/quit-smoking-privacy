    <p>
      All payments are processed securely through
      <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. We do not store, process, or have
      access to your payment details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription status and entitlement management are handled using
      <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service that helps manage

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
